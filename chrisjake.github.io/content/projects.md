## [Part One](http://www.partone.litfl.com/)

An (incomplete, but substantial), [free, open access medical education resource](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FOAMed) and reference for trainees preparing for the CICM and ANZCA Primary Exams.

* Part One **is**:
    * Designed to cover the ***assessed*** sections of the CICM and ANZCA curricula **in enough detail to pass**
    * A rough guide for the expected depth of knowledge required on a topic
    * A tool to correct your written answers
    * A source of information you might find difficult to find elsewhere
* Part One **is not**:
    * A textbook
    * The definitive guide to the primary exam  
    * A complete reference  
    There will be both omissions and errors. If you find any, please <a href="mailto:jake@jakebarlow.me?Subject=Part%20One" target="_top">let me know</a>.


Itâ€™s now part of [Life in the Fast Lane](https://litfl.com/), and you should [check it out](http://www.partone.litfl.com/).
